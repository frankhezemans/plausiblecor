\title{Create grid of correlation coefficient values}
\usage{
create_cor_grid(r, n, n_bins)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Numeric value. The observed sample correlation coefficient.
Must be between -1 and 1.}

\item{n}{Numeric value. The sample size. Used to determine the spread of
points around the observed correlation via Fisher z-transformation.}

\item{n_bins}{Integer. Total number of grid points desired. Will be allocated
proportionally: 70\% for base coverage and 30\% around observed correlation.
Minimum value of 100 is enforced.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of correlation values between -0.999 and 0.999,
sorted in ascending order. The actual number of returned points may
be slightly less than \code{n_bins} due to de-duplication.
}
\description{
Creates a grid of correlation coefficient values for numerical approximation
of posterior densities. The grid begins with evenly spaced coverage from
-0.999 to 0.999, and then more points are added around the observed
correlation for greater precision around the peak of the distribution.
