Coefficient}
\usage{
posterior_rho_updf(r, n, kappa = 1, n_bins = 1000, max_iter = 1e+07, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Numeric value. The observed sample correlation coefficient, must be
between \code{-1} and \code{1}.}

\item{n}{Numeric value. The sample size, must be at least \code{3}.}

\item{kappa}{Numeric value. Parameter controlling the "concentration" of the
stretched beta prior on the correlation coefficient (see details
below). Default is \code{1}, resulting in a uniform prior.}

\item{n_bins}{Integer. Number of grid points for the approximation, default
is \code{1000}.}

\item{max_iter}{Integer. Maximum number of iterations (attempts) to solve
generalised hypergeometric functions that are necessary to compute
the posterior density. Default is \code{1e7}. See details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[stats:approxfun]{stats::approxfun()}}.}
}
\value{
A function that evaluates the unnormalized posterior density at any
correlation value between \code{-1} and \code{1}.
}
\description{
This function calculates the unnormalised posterior density for Pearson's
correlation coefficient based on methods introduced by Ly et al. (2018).
It returns an approximation function that can be evaluated at any correlation
value between -1 and 1.
}
\details{
The unnormalised probability density of the posterior distribution of the
correlation coefficient is computed for a discretised grid of values. Then,
linear interpolation between these density values is used to construct an
approximation to the unnormalised probability density \emph{function} of the
posterior, using \code{\link[stats:approxfun]{stats::approxfun()}}.

The discrete grid of correlation values is set adaptively, so that there are
many estimates of the density near the posterior mode (i.e., the observed
correlation) and near the endpoints of +1 and -1.

Computing the posterior density involves several evaluations of the
generalised hypergeometric function, which is handled internally by
\code{\link[hypergeo:genhypergeo]{hypergeo::genhypergeo()}}. In some cases, especially when the observed
correlation approaches +1 or -1, \code{\link[hypergeo:genhypergeo]{hypergeo::genhypergeo()}} may need several
thousand attempts to find the solution. Here, we cautiously set the default
\code{max_iter} to \code{1e7}, but note that the original default in
\code{\link[hypergeo:genhypergeo]{hypergeo::genhypergeo()}} is much lower (\code{2e3}).

Any undefined or non-finite estimate of the posterior density is treated as
\code{NA} and ignored by \code{\link[stats:approxfun]{stats::approxfun()}} when constructing the function.

The prior is a stretched beta distribution with shape parameters alpha =
beta = 1/kappa, scaled to the interval \link{-1, 1}. This creates a symmetric
distribution centered at zero and its domain stretched to cover the full
range of the correlation coefficient.

This function was adapted from code previously released with the Dynamic
Models of Choice toolbox (Heathcote et al., 2019).
