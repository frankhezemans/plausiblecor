Estimated effect on the response caution parameter from a linear ballistic

\details{
Participants performed a speeded perceptual decision-making task in which they judged
whether a cloud of moving dots appeared to move left or right. Before each trial, an
instructional cue indicated the required emphasis: to respond as **quickly** as
possible (speed condition), as **accurately** as possible (accuracy condition),
or with a **balanced** speed–accuracy trade-off (neutral condition).
These cues were assumed to modulate response caution on a trial-by-trial basis.

The data were fit using an LBA model (Brown & Heathcote, 2008) with a parameterisation
conceptually similar to that used by Forstmann et al. (2008). The LBA assumes evidence
accumulates linearly at a rate drawn from a normal distribution (mean `v`, SD `sv`)
until reaching a threshold `b`, at which point a response is made. The accumulation
process starts from a point drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and `A`.
A non-decision time `t0` is added to account for perceptual and motor latencies.
The threshold was indirectly estimated via the non-negative quantity `B = b - A`.

To test the hypothesis that the speed–accuracy manipulation influenced response
caution, `B` was allowed to vary across the three conditions (speed, neutral,
accuracy). To account for differences in response accuracy, the mean drift rate `v`
varied by response correctness. All other parameters were held constant across
conditions. The standard deviation `sv` was fixed to 1.

Model parameters were estimated using hierarchical Bayesian methods via the
EMC2 package (Stevenson et al., 2025), drawing 6000 posterior samples
(4 chains × 1500 iterations). Following Forstmann et al. (2008), response caution was
quantified as the ratio `b / A`. The reported contrast is the difference in response
caution between the speed condition and the mean of the neutral and accuracy
conditions, providing an estimate of the effect of speed emphasis on response caution.

While the modelling approach here is conceptually similar to that of Forstmann et al.
(2008), the estimation method differs substantially (hierarchical Bayesian vs.
non-hierarchical maximum likelihood). Parameter estimates are therefore not expected
to match exactly.

Note also that subsequent re-analyses suggest more complex model specifications may
better account for these data (see, e.g., the
[EMC2 tutorial chapter on the LBA model](https://bookdown.org/reilly_innes/EMC_bookdown/using-emc2-for-eams-ii---race-models.html)).
