\description{
Estimated fMRI contrasts from Forstmann et al. (2008), representing the
percentage of BOLD signal change in two brain regions: the right anterior
striatum (caudate nucleus) and the right pre-supplementary motor area
(pre-SMA).

\details{
The data were collected while participants performed a speeded perceptual
decision-making task. On each trial, participants judged whether a cloud of
moving dots appeared to move to the left or to the right. Before each trial,
an **instructional cue** indicated the emphasis for that trial: either to
respond as **quickly** as possible (speed condition), as **accurately** as
possible (accuracy condition), or to adopt a **balanced** speed–accuracy
trade-off (neutral condition). These cues manipulated response caution on a
trial-by-trial basis.

The fMRI contrasts reflect results from a group-level conjunction analysis
that identified voxels more active in both the *speed > accuracy* and *speed > neutral*
contrasts, using a cluster-level correction for multiple comparisons at
*P* < 0.001. Brain regions of interest were thus **functionally defined** based on
this contrast-conjunction, and included contiguous voxel clusters in the
right anterior striatum and right pre-SMA that exceeded the critical z-threshold.

To compute the percentage signal change, the time course of the BOLD response
was extracted from the activated voxel clusters in each region for each participant.
The response was measured relative to a baseline defined by null events and
averaged across the 4–8 second window following presentation of the **instructional cue**.
These values reflect increased neural activation in the speed condition relative
to both the neutral and accuracy conditions.
