\title{Compare two distributions of plausible correlation values}
\usage{
compare_plausible_cors(
  x,
  y,
  point_method = c("mean", "median"),
  interval_width = c(0.5, 0.8, 0.95),
  interval_method = c("hdci", "qi"),
  n_samples = 1,
  rng_seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{Data frames returned by \code{\link[=run_plausible_cors]{run_plausible_cors()}}, each containing
the columns \code{.draw}, \code{r}, and \code{posterior_updf}.}

\item{point_method}{Character string specifying the summary point estimate
of the delta distribution. Either \code{"mean"} (default) or \code{"median"}.}

\item{interval_width}{Numeric vector of interval widths (between 0 and 1)
for the uncertainty intervals to be returned. Default is
\code{c(0.5, 0.8, 0.95)}.}

\item{interval_method}{Character string specifying the method used to
compute intervals. Either \code{"hdci"} (highest-density continuous interval;
default) or \code{"qi"} (quantile interval).}

\item{n_samples}{Integer indicating how many quantiles to draw per posterior
distribution when \code{comparison_method = "population"}. Default is 1.}

\item{rng_seed}{Optional numeric vector of length 2 to control the random
seed for quantile sampling of \code{x} and \code{y}, respectively. If \code{NULL},
random seeds will not be set.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble()}} containing summary statistics of the difference
between correlation coefficients.
}
\description{
Compares the posterior distributions of plausible correlation values, as
returned by two separate calls to \code{\link[=run_plausible_cors]{run_plausible_cors()}}. Uses two methods
methods for defining the distribution of the difference: a \strong{sample-based}
comparison, which subtracts the correlation values from matching MCMC
samples, and a \strong{population-based} comparison, which draws quantiles from
each posterior distribution (accounting for population uncertainty) before
computing the difference.
}
\details{
For the sample-based comparison, the function computes the difference in the
Pearson correlation coefficient for each \code{.draw} shared between the two data
frames.

For the population-based comparison, the function draws quantile value(s)
from the posterior distribution of each Pearson correlation (as defined by
\code{posterior_updf}) and computes the difference. This allows for comparison at
the population level rather than the specific sample of subjects.

This function was adapted from code previously released with the Dynamic
Models of Choice toolbox (Heathcote et al., 2019).
